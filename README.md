# Player Behavior Segmentation (Unsupervised ML)

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze gameplay telemetry
and automatically discover distinct player behavior archetypes without predefined labels.

## Objective
The goal is to identify and interpret different types of players (e.g., casual, hardcore,
explorers, risk-takers) based solely on gameplay behavior patterns using clustering methods.

## Key Concepts
- Unsupervised learning (no labeled data)
- Player behavior analytics
- Cluster interpretation and storytelling

## Techniques Used
- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Hierarchical Clustering
- PCA / t-SNE for visualization
- Silhouette Score for cluster evaluation
